This remake is created using the pyglet library.
You can find out more about it here.

## Proof of concept

This is a proof of concept. There are still many many bugs, and it's not really a game.
You can spawn a large ball in the middle using space bar, and move the little character using arrow keys, left and right.
You can shoot a projectile out of the player to split the ball into two.

This was a very unstructured approach. I'm not yet a programmer.
I will make a proper remake of the game, with a much better structured approach to development.
The proof of concept was more of a test for me to see whether I can actually create anything.
Like I previously said, I'm not yet a good programmer, I just started. This is the first thing I have ever created. So, I know that the code is definitely very terrible. However, helpful feedback would be appreciated :)
