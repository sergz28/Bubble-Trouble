You can find out more about it here.
[Pyglet Docs](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/)

This is a proof of concept. Not a full game, just yet.

Game starts with one large ball.
Move around with W-D or Left and Right arrow.
Shoot with SPACE to break up the ball.

*You need to install the pyglet library for this to work. Check requirements.txt*

Python 3.12.4


### To-do List
- Player collision with balls
- Create levels
- Expand on Player class, lives, points, etc
- Main menu
- Create player sprite
- Implement a way to display different scenes, i.e. game-over, main menu, pause.
